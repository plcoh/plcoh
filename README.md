## Abstract

Music playlist creation is a crucial, yet not fully explored task in music data mining and music information retrieval.
Previous studies have largely focused on investigating diversity, popularity, and serendipity of tracks in human- or
machine-generated playlists.
However, the concept of playlist coherence -- vaguely defined as smooth transitions between tracks -- remains poorly
understood and even lacks a standardized definition.
In this paper, we provide a formal definition for measuring playlist coherence based on the sequential ordering of
tracks,
offering a more interpretable measurement compared to existing literature, and allowing for comparisons between
playlists with different musical styles.
The presented formal framework to measure coherence is applied to analyze a substantial dataset of user-generated
playlists, examining how various playlist characteristics influence coherence. We identified four key attributes:
playlist length, number of edits, track popularity, and collaborative playlist curation as potential influencing
factors. Using correlation and causal inference models, the impact of these attributes on coherence across ten auditory
and one metadata feature are assessed.
The findings reveal that these attributes influence coherence to varying degrees, offering valuable insights for
improving the quality of automatic playlist generation and playlist continuation tasks beyond traditional accuracy
metrics. Additionally, these insights can be applied to develop tools for automatic playlist reordering. By
incorporating playlist coherence, music streaming platforms can enhance user satisfaction and increase retention.
